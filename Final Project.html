    <h2>The smart way to start your day</h2>
    <p>
      Porridge is a food made by heating or boiling ground, crushed or chopped
      starchy plants, typically grain, in milk or water. It is often cooked or
      served with added flavourings such as sugar, honey, (dried) fruit or syrup
      to make a sweet cereal, or it can be mixed with spices, meat or vegetables
      to make a savoury dish. It is usually served hot in a bowl, depending on
      its consistency. Oat porridge, or oatmeal, is one of the most common types
      of porridge. Gruel is a thinner version of porridge The term "porridge" is
      often used specifically for oat porridge (oatmeal), which is typically
      eaten for breakfast with salt, sugar, fruit, milk, cream or butter and
      sometimes other flavourings. Oat porridge is also sold in ready-made or
      partly cooked form as an instant breakfast.[citation needed] Other grains
      used for porridge include rice, wheat, barley, corn, triticale and
      buckwheat. Many types of porridge have their own names, such as congee,
      polenta, grits and kasha.[citation needed]. Porridge is eaten for any meal
      of the day and porridge is also eaten in many cultures as a common snack
      and is often eaten by athletes.
